### Welcome to my Coding Bootcamp Diary!

This repository is proof that I survived "Learning Cohort 1.0". Here's the treasure (and evidence) from my journey.

**What's inside:**

* **Static Portfolio Website:** My first attempt at a digital "look at me!" page, built with pure HTML and CSS. It's static, but my enthusiasm was dynamic.

* **Command-Line Grade Calculator:** A Python tool to crush numbers and calculate grades. The bearer of good news... hopefully.

* **Multi-Section Static Website:** A fancier website featuring a responsive navigation bar and a hamburger menu (Warning: not edible).

* **Exercises:** The digital gym where my coding muscles were forged. Contains lots of reps with the fundamentals.
